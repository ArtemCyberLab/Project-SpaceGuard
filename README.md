I developed the SpaceGuard project as the CEO and one of the co-founders. At SpaceGuard, we believe that the future lies in space, and we are actively involved in space research and writing blogs on this topic. We previously helped students with space-related questions, but now we are rebuilding our support system.

Recently, blackhat hackers approached us, claiming they could take over our website and demanding a ransom. To prevent a potential threat, I decided to conduct a security audit of our website and its subdomains. Using various security tools, including scanning and subdomain enumeration, I discovered several critical vulnerabilities.

After scanning for subdomains using gobuster, I found the subdomain portal.spaceguard.thm and added it to the /etc/hosts file for further exploration. I also added blog.spaceguard.thm and support.spaceguard.thm for analysis.

Although nothing useful was found on the blog page, I discovered valuable information on the support page that led me to find the flag. As a result, I was able to prevent a potential attack and strengthen the security of our website.

This project became a key milestone in improving the cybersecurity of our platform, and now we can continue our work on space research with greater confidence.
